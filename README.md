📊 Statistical Analysis Tool

🚀 Overview

The Statistical Analysis Tool is a Python-based project that performs key statistical calculations on a dataset provided by the user. It computes fundamental statistical measures like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, helping users quickly analyze numerical data.

📌 Features

-  ✅ Accepts user input as a list of numbers
-  ✅ Computes mean, median, and mode
-  ✅ Calculates variance and standard deviation
-  ✅ Identifies minimum and maximum values
-  ✅ Handles errors for non-numeric inputs and insufficient data
  
📦 Libraries Used

-  🔥 NumPy - For numerical computations
-  🔥 collections.Counter - For mode detection
  
🎯 How It Works

-  ⚡ The user enters a list of numbers separated by spaces
-  ⚡ The script processes and converts the input into a NumPy array
-  ⚡ It computes mean, median, mode, variance, and other statistics
-  ⚡ The results are displayed in a well-formatted output
-  ⚡ The user can repeat the process with different datasets
  
🔧 Usage Instructions

-  🔹 Run the script
-  🔹 Enter numerical data (minimum of 3 values)
-  🔹 View the computed statistical results
-  🔹 Enter another dataset or exit the script
-  
🛠 Error Handling

-  ⚠️ If a user enters non-numeric values, an error message is displayed
-  ⚠️ If fewer than three numbers are provided, the script prompts for more data
  
📜 Example Output

-  🔎 ENTER THE DATA (Separated by spaces) : 12 18 24 30 36
